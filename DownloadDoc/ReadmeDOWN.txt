ðŸš€ Next Suggestions (if you're planning to improve this)

    Email persistence
    Save the verified email to localStorage so itâ€™s remembered on refresh (optional).

    Basic spam protection
    Rate-limit downloads or add server-side validation of email address.

    Success confirmation after download
    There's already a confirmation message â€” looks good! we could style it more if possible.

    Accessibility & UX polish
    Add loading states, ARIA roles, and keyboard support for extra polish.

    Let me know if you want help:

    Making it mobile-friendly

    Packaging it as a standalone secure page

    Hooking this into a real backend (PHP, Node.js, etc.)

Nice job debugging this â€” you were close to the finish line!
    
/* ==================================================================================================================== */


I'd like to:

    Add a backend handler (e.g., email logging or download tracking)

    Hook in something like Google reCAPTCHA

    Store email addresses to a database (with consent)
