It sounds like you‚Äôre trying to integrate a custom form on your website with **Sender.net** using their **API**, and possibly using **Cloudflare Workers** to do so. You're also encountering a **"Network error. Please check your connection."** issue when trying to connect ‚Äî that could stem from a few sources.

Let‚Äôs break it down and go through the likely causes and solutions.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Checklist to Make Sender.net Integration Work

### ‚û°Ô∏è1. **Verify the API Token**

* Ensure you copied the **correct Sender.net API Token** from your account.
* The API token should have sufficient permissions to:

  * Add subscribers
  * Send emails (like welcome emails, if triggered automatically)
* Test the token via `curl` or Postman to validate it's working:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sender.net/v2/subscribers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "example@example.com", "name": "John"}'
```

Replace:

YOUR_API_TOKEN ‚Üí Your real Sender.net API token

email and name with test data

* If you get a 401 or 403, it's an **auth issue**.

### ‚û°Ô∏è2. **Check Your Worker Setup (Cloudflare Workers)**

‚úÖ Objective

- You want your Cloudflare Worker to:
- Receive form submissions from your website (via POST)
- Validate the consent checkbox
- Send the subscriber data to Sender.net using the API token
- Respond back with success or error

#### In `wrangler.toml`:

Make sure you have:

```toml
name = "my-worker"
type = "javascript"

[vars]
SENDER_API_KEY = "your_actual_token"

[triggers]
routes = ["yourdomain.com/api/subscribe"]

compatibility_date = "2023-08-25"
```

#### Your `index.js` or `worker.js` (basic example):

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    if (request.method === "POST") {
      const body = await request.json();

      const response = await fetch("https://api.sender.net/v2/subscribers", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          Authorization: `Bearer ${env.SENDER_API_KEY}`,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          email: body.email,
          name: body.name,
          custom_fields: {
            consent: body.consent,
          },
        }),
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        return new Response("Failed to subscribe user.", { status: 500 });
      }

      return new Response("Subscribed successfully!", { status: 200 });
    }

    return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
  },
};
```

### ‚û°Ô∏è3. **"Network Error" ‚Äî Where Are You Seeing This?**

#### Possible locations:

* **Browser Console (JS error)?**

  * Check DevTools ‚Üí Console or Network tab.
  * Look for CORS issues or blocked requests.
* **Cloudflare Worker log or deployment output?**

  * Check with:

    ```bash
    wrangler dev
    wrangler publish
    wrangler tail
    ```
* **Sender.net dashboard?**

  * Possibly if you're testing API calls from within their dashboard?

#### Possible causes:

| Cause    | Solution                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **CORS** | Make sure your worker returns proper CORS headers: |

```js
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: "ok" }), {
  headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST",
  },
});
```

\| **Invalid API endpoint or token** | Test API directly using `curl` or Postman. |
\| **Cloudflare Worker failing silently** | Add logging or use `wrangler tail` to debug. |
\| **HTTPS required but not used** | Sender.net API requires HTTPS; ensure fetch is done securely. |

---

### 4. **Ensure Sender.net is Set to Trigger Welcome Email**

* Inside **Sender.net**, go to:

  * **Automation** ‚Üí Create or Edit a Workflow
  * Trigger: ‚ÄúWhen a subscriber is added to a list‚Äù
  * Action: Send Email (welcome email)
* Make sure your API request is adding the user to the correct **list** that triggers the automation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Debug This Now

### A. Test API Key with Postman or curl

Check if it works outside of Cloudflare.

### B. Test Worker Endpoint with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User", "consent": true}'
```

### C. Use `wrangler tail` to see real-time logs

```bash
wrangler tail
```

Watch for errors thrown inside your worker function.

## üéÅ Optional: I Can Review Your Code

If you paste:

* Your `wrangler.toml`
* Your worker script (JS)
* The HTML form you're using

I can double-check for anything out of place.
