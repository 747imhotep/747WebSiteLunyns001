Yes, it is **absolutely possible** to create a secure upload page where customers:

1. **Enter their email address**
2. **Upload sensitive documents**
3. Do **not receive a download** unless needed later

But: handling **sensitive documents** means you must design the system with **privacy, security, and compliance** in mind.

### ‚úÖ Basic Functional Requirements

* **Form** with:

  * Email input
  * File input (PDFs, images, etc.)
  * Submit button

* **Server-side backend** to:

  * Handle the file securely
  * Validate/store the email
  * Optionally send confirmation or future follow-up
  * Store the file securely (e.g., encrypted on disk or cloud storage)

* **Security essentials**:

  * HTTPS-only site
  * File validation (type, size, virus scan if needed)
  * Avoid storing files in public folders (e.g., no direct link access)
  * Avoid email spoofing, use verified email services (SendGrid, SES, etc.)

### üõ°Ô∏è Important Considerations for Sensitive Documents

* **GDPR / privacy laws**: If you're in the EU or serving EU customers, you **must** include a privacy notice and possibly gain explicit consent for processing data.
* **Storage limits and cleanup**: Auto-delete files after X days if they're no longer needed.
* **No client-side processing for sensitive data** ‚Äî don‚Äôt try to handle privacy-sensitive uploads purely in JavaScript without a backend.
* **Access control**: Only authorized team members should be able to view the uploads.

### ‚ú® Optional Features

* Confirmation email to the customer (‚ÄúWe received your documents.‚Äù)
* Dashboard or email notification for admin review
* Password-protected area if customers need to return

### üõ†Ô∏è Want a Starter Tech Suggestion?

* Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap or Tailwind for the form
* Backend: Node.js with Express + Multer for file uploads
* Storage: AWS S3 with restricted access
* Email: SendGrid for transactional email

I can give you a full code template or outline for this if you'd like ‚Äî just tell me what stack or hosting you're planning to use.
